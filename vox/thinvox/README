"thinvox" reads a voxel file (in .binvox or MIRA format) and applies a
template-based thinning method to it.  Currently it only supports the
directional thinning method described by Kálmán Palágyi and Attila
Kuba in Directional 3D Thinning Using 8 Subiterations, Springer-Verlag
Lecture Notes in Computer Science volume 1568, pp. 325-336, 1999.

compiling under Linux
---------------------

cd binvox-0.34/vox/thinvox
setenv OS LINUX
make


compiling under Mac OS X
------------------------

Download the xcode development environment from Apple.
Make sure you also install (find these in the Packages
folder of the disk image):
- gcc-4.0
- DeveloperTools
- DevSDK

cd binvox-0.34/vox/thinvox
setenv OS LINUX
make

The "OS" variable is still set to LINUX because of the
minor differences between the two. The makefiles rely
on an environment variable VENDOR to be set to "apple"
for the MAC OS X specific tweaks (so do a setenv VENDOR apple
if that one for some reason isn't set).



compiling under Windows
-----------------------

Install cygwin (available at www.cygwin.com). Make sure
to get gcc, tcsh, and make.

The steps below assume you've decompressed the binvox-0.34.tar.gz
to a directory C:\binvox-0.34

From a command shell (start -> run -> cmd), type:
- tcsh
- setenv OS WINDOWS
- cd /cygdrive/c/binvox-0.34/vox/thinvox
- make

This will create thinvox.exe in that same directory.
